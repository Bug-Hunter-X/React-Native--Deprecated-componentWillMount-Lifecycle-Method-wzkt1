This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native involving the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method.  The original `bug.js` file shows the problematic code using `componentWillMount`. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct solution using `componentDidMount`.  This is a vital fix for ensuring compatibility with modern React Native versions and preventing unexpected runtime behavior.
