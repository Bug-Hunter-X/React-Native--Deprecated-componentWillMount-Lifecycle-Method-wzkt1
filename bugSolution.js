The solution is to replace `componentWillMount` with `componentDidMount`. This lifecycle method executes after the component is mounted into the DOM, ensuring that state updates happen after the component is fully rendered. Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

class MyComponent extends Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    // Fetch data or perform other operations here
    this.setState({ data: 'Data fetched!' });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This corrected code uses `componentDidMount` to set state after the component is mounted. This is a safer and more consistent approach within the latest React Native versions.
