This React Native code causes an error because it uses the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method.  This method is no longer supported in newer versions of React Native and will cause warnings or errors during development and runtime.  The code attempts to set state within `componentWillMount` which is a common pattern, but no longer recommended.
